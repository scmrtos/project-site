# Features

#### Written entirely on C++:

* High reliability
* Simplicity and ease-of-use

#### Introduce Extensions mechanism at kernel level:

* User defined extensions
* Debug features


#### Minimal process switching latency:

* 900 ns on Cortex-M4 @ 168 MHz
* 1.8 us on Blackfin @ 200 MHz
* 2.7 us on Cortex-M3 @ 72 MHz
* 700 ns on Cortex-A9 @ 400 MHz (with full FPU context save/restore)
* 5 us on ARM7 @ 50 MHz
* 38-42 us on AVR @ 8 MHz
* 45-50 us on MSP430 @ 5 MHz
* 18-20 us on STM8 @ 16 MHz


#### Footprint:

* from 512 bytes of RAM
* from ~1K code
